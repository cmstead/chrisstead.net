We've all been there at some point or another.  A new project is just about to start.  Everyone in the know is bracing for impact and the people who are going to contribute are blissfully unaware of the monster lurking around the corner.

Generally the kickoff goes like this:

"Hey, everyone, our client needs an update to their website.  You know what you need to do, so let's hit it.  Peace out."

Do they know what they need to do?  At a high level, maybe?  Probably not, really.

Stakeholders don't know what's coming.  The client doesn't know what they need.  The design and development units are waiting until the other one is done with "their part."  In the end, everyone scrambles at the 11th hour and the project comes together. Barely.

Let's hit rewind and do this kickoff the right way.  If you are a team lead, figure out what you need.  Sort out who your users are and what business needs are being addressed on your site.  Contact stakeholders early, share what you need and the listen to what they want. Use this to sort out your priorities.  Organize the moving parts, call your team together and give them the rundown.

Once people have their marching orders, collect everyone for happy hour.  This is the first step in a long journey, start it with a cheers instead of a fizzle.  Kick off your projects right and make the web a better place.
