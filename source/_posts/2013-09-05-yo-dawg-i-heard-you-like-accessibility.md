So I put accessibility in your menus so your users can use your site even if they are disabled.

Okay, so I suck at yo, dawg jokes. I did, however make a handy little menu script.  It's small. It's functional. It supports accessibility features like roles and keyboard access. It's easy to turn some plain old HTML into a menu without having to know ANY javascript.  Am I a mad genius? Quite possibly, but I'll take what I can get.

So, here's the deal, you can download the alpha release at the following link:

<a href="https://github.com/cmstead/ClickBeetleJS/releases/tag/v0.5-alpha">https://github.com/cmstead/ClickBeetleJS/releases/tag/v0.5-alpha</a>

If you want to actually code and help make it better you can fork the project here:

<a href="https://github.com/cmstead/ClickBeetleJS">https://github.com/cmstead/ClickBeetleJS</a>

Important things you should know:

ClickBeetleJS requires jQuery.
Pull requests won't be accepted without passing tests associated.
All my tests are written with QUnit. Please write yours using the same framework.

I hope this is useful for you.

Help me make the web a better place.
