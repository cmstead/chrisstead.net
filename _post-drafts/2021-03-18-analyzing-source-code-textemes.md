In the world of linguistics there is a discipline called morphology. Morphology is the study of individual units of meaning in language. The reason it's not meaningology (formally semantics or pragmatics) is because it's not so much about the meaning, but about how the form impacts the possible meanings of language.

Programming languages, themselves, are a formally constructed, math-adjacent notation which we use to communicate with computers, and other humans. That last part is what I find most interesting. Communicating with computers is a straightforward, if potentially laborious, undertaking. Computing really gets tricky when we start getting humans involved.
